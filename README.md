# dverse Portfolio

## Description
I created a single page application using React.js. This application contains an About page, Portfolio page, Contact page, and Resume page. Inside of the portfolio page i have 4 projects to showcase my developer skills. As for the Resume page, it contains a link to my resume and a list of all the systems and applications I've used and learned over the course. Finally, located in the footer, there are links to my Github, LinkedIn, and Twitter.
